# GIV-Project

Welcome to my first University Project

ERP-based Application - Scalable and Extensible

This university project is built on the principles of an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system and could serve as a scalable solution for managing key business operations. Designed with a PostgreSQL database, the application integrates modules for sales, inventory management, product flow, user management, and report generation.

Structured under the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, the project represents a solid foundation for a more comprehensive application tailored to the needs of its users. It marks a small but meaningful step towards creating better, more adaptable software solutions.
